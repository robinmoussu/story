Let's get back to the topic in hand, you will have tree attempt to succed you
mission, one as a dwarf \ref{dwarf}, one as an elf \ref{elf}, and one as a

another adventurer.

\section{human}

As a human, you have a general knowledge of the local region. People can help
you, but will still consider you as a stranger.

Sometime, you are supertitious, and you know that going into the darkest place
of a forest can be a bad idea.

You are mercenary. The local lord, Beoson appointed you as a dragon killer. You
will not fail in you task, and you are well trained. When this task will be
completed, you will have to see him back to claim your bounty.

As soon as the appointment was taken, and after shaking you hand a sign of trust

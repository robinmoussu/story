\section{start}

Your adventure will take place in the country of Greenhil. You came there as soon
as you heard that a dragon have settled in that area. Even if there are only
humans in that region, it is not uncommon to see dwarfs, elves, or even magical
creatures.

Oh, I forgot to teach you that in this book, you will have to make choices. Each
time you see a number like this~(\ref{start}), you can jump to that section.
It is sometimes a mandatory choose.

Let's get back to the topic. You will have tree attempt, one as a
dwarf~(\ref{dwarf}), one as an elf~(\ref{elf}), and one as a
human~(\ref{human}). Choose wisely, and be successful.

\section{xx}

Oh! What are you doing? You cannot go to that paragraph. Go back
to~(\ref{start}) little cheater!

\section{human}

As a human, you have a general knowledge of the local region. People can help
you, but will still consider you as a stranger. Even if you are a mercenary you
are a bit superstitious. You know that going into the darkest place of a forest
can be a bad idea, at least without a guide.

Beoson, the local lord, appointed you as a dragon killer. When your task will be
completed you will have to bring back a trophy to claim your bounty. You shake
your hands with Beoson as a sign of trust, then you go back to the courtyard of
this castle~(\ref{courtyard}).

\section{dwarf}

You are a proud representative of dwarfs warriors, with your axe of first
quality. You came into that region because you know that all the dragons hold a
treasure. It is maybe your chance to become rich and influent in your own
underground kingdom.

When you were young, your granny always repeated you that forests are the
dangerous places in that world. You remember the warm coming from the
stone's fireplace, and her soft voice in her beard. It was so contrasting with
her warning. They are no way to go in those place, even with a guide.

But nowadays, you are an adventurer. The weather is cloudy, and the air is
fresh. Your story begin in the country~(\ref{field}).

\section{elf}

When you heard that a dragon come to the country of Greenhil, you though it was
time to make something of your life. You are young, only two or three hundred
of spring. Your objective is to study that mighty creature. When you will have
completed that first quest, you will also have to meet an old priest that live
somewhere in the country before leaving the region.

Your adventure begins in the best place that you can encounter: the edge of a
wood~(\ref{edge_of_the_wood})!

\section{castle_entrance}

You stand front the closed gate of the castle. A guard shout out:

-- Hey stranger, what are you doing here?

If you are a human, you can respond that you are currently in a mission for Lord
Beoson, and the watchman will open you the gate~(\ref{courtyard}).

Otherwise, the sentry will ignore you without restraint. The only choose
left to you is going back to the country~(\ref{field}).

\section{courtyard}

The inside of the castle of Picsalt is muddy, like many strongholds. You don't
delay yourself for such a detail. If you have a proof that you have killed a
dragon, then you will be allowed to access to the apartments of the lord
(\ref{lord}).

Otherwise, go back to your quest outside of this castle. They are no dragon
there! You can take your time in the local countryside~(\ref{field}) or walk in
one go directly to Greenhil, the nearest village~(\ref{village}).

\section{lord}

With a warm welcome, lord Beoson beg you a proof of your exploit.  You open
your purse and clears out its contents on a table. Beoson come close,
intrigues. You get out of your stuff the two eyes of the dragon.

-- Nice job, said the lord.

Only with a short glance, he gives some order to his chamberlain. Few time
later, the domestic come back with a small chest: the five thousand coins of
your reward!

\medbreak

Congratulation, you have accomplished your mission. Do you want to try again as a
Dwarf~(\ref{dwarf}) or as an elf~(\ref{elf})?

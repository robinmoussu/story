\section{village}

You are into Greenhil, a small village. Somme kids are playing into
the mud. Even if the roof of the thatched cottage are not in their prime youth,
the inhabitants don't seem to starve.

You gaze around you, looking for some shop. You found a
smithy~(\ref{blacksmith}), and a tavern (\ref{tavern}). During your research, a
little girl got your attention~(\ref{children}).

\section{blacksmith}

You come to the forge. The blacksmith is working, hurting a piece of iron with
his hamer. He is probably creating a sword.

If your are a dwarf, shout out him in~(\ref{blacksmith_dwarf}), otherwise look his
work on~(\ref{blacksmith_nothing}).

\section{children}

Unlike what you were expected, the children are talkative. Even if their speech
are a bit rambling, you get the main idea. Near the forest, a huge monster
(probably your dragon) was seen. A child added, that it's not a good idea to go
to the darkest place in the forest.

After that break, you can go to the blacksmith~(\ref{blacksmith}) or take a drink in
the tavern~(\ref{tavern}).

\section{blacksmith_dwarf}

In your opinion, dwarfs are the best blacksmiths in that world. You look amused
by the simplicity of his work. If you really need a new weapon, your can
purchase a sword.

You decide to take a drink in the tavern~(\ref{tavern}).

\section{blacksmith_nothing}

You watch with attention the craftsman work. The way he model the steel is
facinating. You exchange some banalty. Since you have no need of the fruit
of his labor, you will go back to the main place of the village~(\ref{village}).

\section{tavern}

You enter into the tavern. It is called \textit{Deadly scorpion}, even if
alcools look as dangerous as fresh water! At least, the air is hot, and the
peoples look hostpitable.

You can drink alone in~(\ref{tavern_drink}), or install yourself with the others
customers to listen rumours~(\ref{rumour}).

\section{human_drink_victory}

You are proud of your victory! You walk to Greenhil with a cheerful pace. Once
you arrived in the village, you find your way to the tavern~(\ref{tavern_drink}).

\section{tavern_drink}

The wine looks so rough and the beer smells so hard that you have preffer to
take a cup of mead. There is so little to do in that place, that you take a
second one, and a third, â€¦ to the point you start falling.

You choose to stay in that establishment to sleep. The baterder give you a place in the
straw, with a cow, in exchange of some coins. It's not fair, but you are too drunk
to protest.

You sleep in one go until~(\ref{village_morning}).

\section{rumour}

The inhabitant of Greenhil are simple farmers, but they know their realm in
details. After speaking of the sun, the influence of the moon on their beans and
on the tax, they finally give an usefull information. The lumberjack saw
recently some scarry track.

Glanning all those hearsay took you the whole afternoon. The \textit{Deadly
scorpion} is also a place where you can eat and sleep, so you choose to stay
there for the night.

The inkeeper serve you some meat with beam of the last year. It is not
excellant, but at least your stomach is full! After that, you go to sleep in a
small bedroom with a bed of straw~(\ref{village_morning}).

\section{village_morning}

It was a good night. The cockerel wake you with the first sunbeams. You stand
up, some wisp still in your hair.

You decide to start your day as fast as possible, and to leave that village.
You can go into open lands~(\ref{field}), the main road~(\ref{road}), or
going to the edge of the nearest forest~(\ref{lumberjack}).

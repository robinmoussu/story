\section{road}

You walk during approximately a mile before reaching a marker sign. If you are
an adventurer with a gold treasure, you can continue your journey far from there and
the dragon~(\ref{goblins}).

Otherwise, the village of Greenhil is indicated on the west~(\ref{village}), and
the road continue in direction of the Picsalt castle~(\ref{field}). A last
choose is offer only for dwarfs: follow a small beaten path~(\ref{track}).

\section{field}

The road snakes between some small fields. The weather is cloudy and sad, but
your are full of energy.

You take a break to admire the panorama. Some sunbeams cross clouds to
illuminate farmers. The ploughmen are leaning on their swing plough, probably
chatting about the constantly changing weather.

The landscape is otherworldly with a vast forest filled of mist in the
background~(\ref{edge_of_the_wood}). In its border, there is a small chapel made
of stone~(\ref{chapel}). In the opposite direction, an old castle overlook the
vale~(\ref{castle_entrance}).

You notice the smoke of some house behind a hill. That should be a village. You
are pretty sure that you can found some information over there~(\ref{village}).


\section{goblins}

You are a rich dwarf! Those words nicely in your head. You walk with a cheerful
pace, your mind a bit elsewhere when suddenly some goblins jumps all around
you! I hope you have taken the time to find a new weapon after defeating the dragon. If
you were wise, pull it out in~(\ref{dwarf_victory}).

If not, â€¦ do what can be~(\ref{dwarf_death}).

\section{dwarf_victory}

The small creatures underestimated you. With a nimble gesture, you took your new
sword. You defeat them, some dragon fire in your eyes. The battle is epic, but
quite short. Your aggressor run away, far from your revenge.

You salvage what can be found on their warm corpses. Then, in one gesture you
clean your weapon and put it away. It is a good sword, even if the quality is
lower than your broken axe. Nevertheless, it is good enough to suit your needs.
Your continue your journey, confident in your future. Congratulation!

\medbreak

Do you think you will have such a great adventure as a human~(\ref{human}) or
an elf~(\ref{elf})?

\section{dwarf_death}

Dear god of dwarf, your axe is broken! Without having the time to improvise
anything, your opponents jump on you. Their tiny claws impale your body. Your
death is so shameful, that you are not sure that you will be able to resurrect as
a human~(\ref{human}), not even as an elf~(\ref{elf}).

\section{lost}

The wood seems darker and darker. You have the impression to be stared by a
malicious presence. 

...

At a point you are sur that you are lost. You are sure that you are lost. I
cannot help you. To be honnest, I will not even remember you. It's the end.

Maybe you will be more careful as a human \ref{human}, a dwarf \ref{dwarf} or an
elf \ref{elf}.

\section{edge_of_the_wood}

You stand at the edge of the wood. If you are a dwarf progress immediatly on
\ref{dwarf_edge_of_the_wood}.

Otherwise, you walk between trees and bushes. You have a strange impression.
That forest seems to have its own personnality. At a point, you notice that you
cannot see anymore the edge of the wood. Hopefully, you see a clearing not too
far away \ref{clearing}.

\section{clearing}

You have the feeling to circle in that forest.

If it is the first clearing that you found, go to \ref{clearing_1}, otherwise
you arrive at \ref{clearing_2}.

\section{clearing_1}

You feel that it is a good time to take a nap and nibble a bit.

After that break, you are in better form. You look all around you. The only
thing that you cann see is trees. You can guess the sound of a river in the
far-off \ref{river}. At the opposite direction, the lobed-leaved trees seems
older, like if they were darker and more majestic (\ref{old_tree}).

\section{clearing_2}

Only an elf can notice the small differences between the much

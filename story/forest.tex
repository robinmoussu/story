\section{lost}

The wood seems darker and darker. You have the impression to be stared by a
malicious presence.

At a point you are sur that you are lost. You are sure that you are lost. I
cannot help you. To be honnest, I will not even remember you. It's the end.

Maybe you will be more careful as a human \ref{human}, a dwarf \ref{dwarf} or an
elf \ref{elf}.

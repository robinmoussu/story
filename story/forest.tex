\section{lost}

The wood seems darker and darker. You have the impression to be stared by a
malicious presence. 

...

At a point you are sure that you are lost. I
cannot help you. To be honnest, I will not even remember you. It's the end.

Maybe you will be more careful as a human \ref{human}, a dwarf \ref{dwarf} or an
elf \ref{elf}.

\section{edge_of_the_wood}

You stand at the edge of the wood. If you are a dwarf progress immediatly on
\ref{dwarf_edge_of_the_wood}.

Otherwise, you walk between trees and bushes. You have a strange impression.
That forest seems to have its own personnality. At a point, you notice that you
cannot see anymore the edge of the wood. Hopefully, you see a clearing not too
far away \ref{clearing}.

\section{dwarf_edge_of_the_wood}

Your mother did not repeat you enough time that going into the forest is the
worst thing you can ever done? All forest are evil, the all full of trees! You
have the immediate feeling that it was a really bad idea to came here.

You roam under the terrifying oaks, and the malicious pine tree until
\ref{lost}.

\section{clearing}

You have the feeling to circle in that forest.

If it is the first clearing that you found, go to \ref{clearing_1}, otherwise
you arrive at \ref{clearing_2}.

\section{clearing_1}

You feel that it is a good time to take a nap and nibble a bit.

After that break, you are in better form. You look all around you. The only
thing that you cann see is trees. You can guess the sound of a river in the
far-off \ref{river}. At the opposite direction, the lobed-leaved trees seems
older, like if they were darker and more majestic (\ref{old_tree}).

\section{clearing_2}

Only an elf can notice the small differences between all thoses trees and keep a
sane mind in that strange forest. If you are a -digne représentant du peuple
sylvain-, you notice something in \ref{\natural_basin}.

Otherwise, you have no idea where you are. You walk with fewer and fewer hope of
going out of this forest one day. Move yourself in \ref{lost}.

\section{natural_basin}

Your sharpened eyes saw small light in the undereath the leaves. The only
thing that can do that is water. You walk in that direction and found a pond
of vision. It's a perfect circle of white stone that contain pure water. You
lean, and suddenly the reflets turn cloudy. An image appears at
the surface of the liquid. Even if it is not clear, you have the feeling that
it's a map of the region. At the west of a village, in the country, theire is an
old site of prayer. But what catch youre attention is something on the est,
near you.

The vision shade off progressively. You take a short nap, and eat a bit
given that magic is something tiring. Then, find your way using a decided step
in \ref{track}.

\section{track}
\section{river}

You follow during a long time a small river, that snakes between the trees.
The atmosphere is oppressive, full of humidity.

Faw away, make out a deaden sound. It's repetitive. Something like
``Tchack… tchack… tchack…''. You can get a step closer (\ref{lumberjack}).

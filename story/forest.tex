\section{lost}

The wood seems darker and darker. You have the impression to be stared by a
malicious presence.

The light decrease progressively. You have an awfull night. Each time you start
to sleep, something get wake you up with a start.

The next day, you continue to walk, hoping to escape of that place. At a point
you are sure that you are lost. I cannot help you. To be honnest, I will not
even remember you. It's the end.

\medbreak

Maybe you will be more careful in your next incarnation as a human \ref{human}, a dwarf \ref{dwarf} or an
elf \ref{elf}.

\section{edge_of_the_wood}

You stand at the edge of the wood. If you are a dwarf progress immediatly on
\ref{dwarf_edge_of_the_wood}.

Otherwise, you walk between trees and bushes. You have a strange impression.
That forest seems to have its own personnality. At a point, you notice that you
cannot see anymore the edge of the wood. Hopefully, you see a clearing not too
far away \ref{clearing_1}.

\section{dwarf_edge_of_the_wood}

Your greatmother did not repeat you enough time that going into the forest is
the worst thing you can ever done? All forest are evil, the all full of trees!
You have the immediate feeling that it was a really bad idea to came here.

You roam under the terrifying oaks, and the malicious pine tree~(\ref{lost}).

\section{clearing_1}

You feel that it is a good time to take a nap and nibble a bit.

After that break, you are in better form. You look all around you. The only
thing that you cann see is trees. You can guess the sound of a river in the
far-off \ref{river}. At the opposite direction, the lobed-leaved trees seems
older, like if they were darker and more majestic~(\ref{old_tree}).

\section{clearing_2}

You have the feeling to circle in that forest. Only an elf can notice the small
differences between all thoses trees and keep a sane mind in that strange
forest. If you are a -digne représentant du peuple sylvain-, you notice
something in \ref{natural_basin}.

Otherwise, you have no idea where you are. You walk with fewer and fewer hope of
going out of this forest one day. Move yourself in \ref{lost}.

\section{natural_basin}

Your sharpened eyes saw small light in the undereath the leaves. The only
thing that can do that is water. You walk in that direction and found a pond
of vision. It's a perfect circle of white stone that contain pure water. You
lean, and suddenly the reflets turn cloudy. An image appears at
the surface of the liquid. Even if it is not clear, you have the feeling that
it's a map of the region. At the west of a village, in the country, theire is an
old site of prayer. But what catch youre attention is something on the est,
near you.

The vision shade off progressively. You take a short nap, and eat a bit
given that magic is something tiring. Then, find your way using a decided step
in \ref{track}.

\section{river}

You follow during a long time a small river, that snakes between the trees.
The atmosphere is oppressive, full of humidity.

Faw away, make out a deaden sound. It's repetitive. Something like
``\textit{Tchack… tchack… tchack…}''. You can get a step closer~(\ref{lumberjack}), or
going in the opposite direction, far from the river and thoses strange noises
(\ref{clearing_2}).

\section{old_tree}

You have a strange impression. The trees that surround you are not only old, but
it is like that have some sort of a conciousness. You do not fell in your proper
place.

Hopefully, you quickly found another clearing~(\ref{clearing_2}). You feel a bit
better after leaving that area.

\section{lumberjack}

You progress between the trees, following some sort of a path. Your step will
carry you in front of a small house. A man is cutting wood with is axe. The
lumberjack notice you and greets you.

You take the time to discuss with him, and share some food with him. The guy is
nice, and when you explain that your try to found a dragon, he explain to you
where he saw some gigantics tracks for the last time.

The lumberjack guide you during half of the distance. He say it is too dangerous
now for him to continue, but describe with precision where he think that will be
able to find the mighty creature. After he go back to his work.

If you are a dwarf your progression with brought you on
\ref{dwarf_edge_of_the_wood}, if not you will arrive in \ref{track}.

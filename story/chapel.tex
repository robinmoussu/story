\section{chapel}

You enter in the small chapel. The architecture is gothic. There is not so much
light inside, even if the small stained glasses try to bring some ray on a
statue.

You sit on a bench and engage yourself in a private prayer. Aftewards you walk
back out into the fresh air.

A churchman seems to be busy on a manuscript. You can either engage him in
conversation~(\ref{priest}), or enter into the nearest
forest~(\ref{edge_of_the_wood}). Some mighty creature might leave in that place.

\section{priest}

The old man is concentrate on his work. You salute him in your native language.
If you are an elf, he replies you in~(\ref{priest_elf}).

Otherwise, he blesses you quickly and continue his work. In that case, you feel
sorry to disturbated him. You decide either to enter into the
forest~(\ref{edge_of_the_wood}) or to get back the main road~(\ref{road}).

\section{priest_elf}

The ecclesiatic raise his head in your direction.

-- It's been a long period since the last time I've seen an elf. What are you
doing here?

You explain that you heared the rumour that maybe a dragon may leave in that
country, and you came to study it to the priest.

At the beggining of that story, you bring a flask with you. If it is still
empty, continue your discussion in~(\ref{priest_quest}). Otherwise, pull it
out~(\ref{theologie}).

\section{priest_quest}

The old man look at you, and adds:

-- You should go into the forest. Some rumour say that dragons' tracks have been
seen there. That forest is dangerous, but since you are an elf, it will not be a
problem to locate yourself. When you will found and study the creature, come
back here.

You thank him and assure that you will come back. You leave of the chapel, and
enter into to forest~(\ref{edge_of_the_wood}).

\section{theologie}

You show the dragon's tears inside your flask to the churchman. The old man seems
facinated by the reflects of the iridescent light that arise from the liquid.

He leads you in his library. He pulls a book and start to teach you the advanced
magical properties of the dragon's tears. That discussion is simply
pationnating. When you have finnished, you thank him warmfully to transfert his
knowledge.

Congratulation, you quest is ended. Now you are free to continue a new
adventure. Maybe you can try as a human~(\ref{human}), or as a
dwarf~(\ref{dwarf}).

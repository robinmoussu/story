\section{start}

Hi, adventurer. Look how strong and inteligent you look, with the wind in your
air. I'm proud of you. You're brave. You came from far away, because you've
heared theire is a dragon in that earldom.

** pr√©sentation du monde

You should be asking yourself who I am. I'm your conscience. To be more
precisise, I'm the conscience of three adventurer: a dwarf, a man, and an elf.
Witch one are you?

Oh, I forgot to teach you that in this book, you will have to make choises. Each
time you see a number like this **number**, you can jump to that section.

Let's get back to the topic in hand, you will have tree attempt to succed you
mission, one as a dwarf \ref{dwarf}, one as an elf \ref{elf}, and one as a
\ref{human}. Choose wise, and be successfull. If not, you can try again as
another adventurer.

\section{human}

As a human, you have a general knowledge of the local region. People can help
you, but will still consider you as a stranger.

Sometime, you are supertitious, and you know that going into the darkest place
of a forest can be a bad idea.

You are mercenary. The local lord, Beoson appointed you as a dragon killer. You
will not fail in you task, and you are well trained. When this task will be
completed, you will have to see him back to claim your bounty.

As soon as the appointment was taken, and after shaking you hand a sign of trust
with Beoson, you go back to the courtyard of this castel \ref{courtyard}.

\section{courtyard}

The inside of the castel of Picsalt is ...

You can acces to the apartment of the lord only if you have a proof that you
killed the dragon \ref{lord}.

If this is not the case, then go search it! You can take your time in the local
contryside \ref{field} or walk in one go directly to Greenhil, the nearing
village \ref{village}.

\section{lost}

The wood seems darker and darker. You have the impression to be stared by a
malicious presence. 

...

At a point you are sur that you are lost. You are sure that you are lost. I
cannot help you. To be honnest, I will not even remember you. It's the end.

Maybe you will be more careful as a human \ref{human}, a dwarf \ref{dwarf} or an
elf \ref{elf}.
